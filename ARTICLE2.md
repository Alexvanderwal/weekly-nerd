# Good design shows humanity
We, developers, designers & everyone involved in making websites is responsible to create a great experience for the users we have thought about and anticipated. But more often than not,
we forget a really important group of users, the people we didn't think of directly. 
Think about blind users, grandma that can barely identify her grandson. But more than that, 'healthy' people
don't always use the product in an ideal situation, for example, if the screen is shining brightly, 
or your hands are shaking from the cold.

## But how does taking this into account result in a better design?
This question was actually floating around in my head before `Web Design`, a class during the minor revolving around designing a website for a specific user (in my case a blind user).
Because she was blind, I realized that designing the way I always do, just drawing some basic shapes and start to CSS/HTML it till it looks nice, won't work. After all, content is the most important for my user.

So what I decided to do was to instead of drawing, I'd write the user interface down. As I was making a forum, I started at the display of a thread. I wrote down who made the thread, how late, if he/she was online, their name was, what the title was and how many reactions there have been and when the last one was. I tried to do this in one sentence so it would feel really natural to be read about by the screen reader. Doing it this way caused me to really step out of my perspective on how I wanted to make it. I quickly realized that I wanted to take this sentence and keep it intact, and style around this.

Through adhering to this concept, I feel like I was able to channel my creativity more as the semantics where already there, I knew how I wanted to deliver my data from an audio point of view, so I could take this and translate this into something unique design-wise.

In my eyes, the reason why it works so well is that it has been made to please everyone, and not only myself, yet it still keeps my character as I wasn't limiting myself to my abilities to design something quickly and translate it to HTML, which felt incredibly liberating. For me personally, it also clicked because I'm a software Engineer as background, and seeing how I could use my data to give a proper story to the user instead of just throwing it into a template made me so much invested in making something worthwhile. I feel like this is also part of the lesson the course tries to hand to the students. In the course, we also learned about design patterns and rules that help you to make a more concrete design that is easy to understand and use. By combining this with 'unique' users you are really forced to channel all the creativity possible. 

That's partially why I wanted to write this article, while I don't try to say that people that just design for 1 group of users don't make good designs, I do believe that the group that tries to put that extra bit of love into their design for edge cases really make a more concrete and unique design. And even if it doesn't, it did change my vision about web design completely.
