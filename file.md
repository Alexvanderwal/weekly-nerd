# Technological knowledge can hinder your design.
As someone with quite an extensive knowledge about all things tech, it really dawned on me that the experience I've gathered actually slowed me down at times.
For example, where I was trying to stop for example a really creative idea because it felt like scope creeps, I was actually limiting the ways we could divert it.
This is just one of many examples, but I really feel gutted by this idea that we become so biased the more we learn, that we shut down ideas pre-emotively due to the bad experiences we had, not taking into consideration that our team members didn't have these experiences yet.
Of course, it's not always a bad thing, but at least hearing these idea's and figuring out something against the mistakes you made earlier could fuel the creativity allot more.

But this post isn't necessarily about professionals, what I was more surprised at was *how* creative and out of the box developers can think because they have no biases whatsoever.
I came to experience this because of a minor student that enrolled with no technical background whatsoever. Even though he struggled really, *really* hard, his designs were unique, daring, challenging and out-of-the-box.
For me, a technical person, it was amazing to see, but I quickly realized that this isn't just great for me, it's great for people interested in website building as well.
Being able to experience this extremely creative process early on can really shape who you are, but also open up what makes a design so much fun, playing with completely new ideas for you. 
Having the power to inspire seasoned tech-nerds is something you really shouldn't take lightly, especially if you would potentially want to work in the field.

I know what you're thinking, that's great and all, but how do * I* fuel my creativity more? Well, the answer is with lesser experience people as well I feel like.
Opening up and teaching people the basics but letting them do how they envision something will allow you to grow further since they will run off to directions you have already blocked inside your head.
Or, the other way around, diving into something completely new for you and letting you be guided by someone else could really spark your creativity, and in my opinion, is really needed from time to time for serious tech people.
Because, let's face it, doing the same thing all day is really boring. There is a reason why there are more Javascript Libraries than people on earth (source needed). We want to keep exploring and do things differently, sometimes without the biases we already have.
We want to experience that feeling how it's like to be a noob again. So, embrace that fact, and start being more of a noob. For your sake, and your creative process.
