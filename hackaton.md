# Hackaton
On the may 20th the minor web development made us attend a half-day hackaton for the [http://www.hva.nl/opleiding/en/master-digital-design/master-digital-design.html](master digital design).  

## Introduction
The students/attendee's had allot of crazy and fun idea's; a sensor to manipulate sleep patterns, a app to record interviews and have a easy overview, a 'note' system for images and more!  
Between these concept there was one in particulair that sparked my interest, *myGappie*, pitched by [Gabrielle Claushuis](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/gabrielle-claushuis-46047580). This concept was aiming to make victims of stalking/assualts in the public feel more save by allowing these victims  
to quickly 'mass-call' multiple friends/family members to ensure a quick response. What really peaked my interest about this concept was that it was quite clear the one who thought about the concept,  
didn't really work out the details, which ment to me that there were allot of design challenges that could be tackled.  
In the end A team of 4 including myself decided to accompany Gabrielle.

## The in's and outs of MyGappie
After the team formed, we got a run down from Gabrielle about MyGappie.  
To be quite frank, I was quite shocked at first. It became clear that the concept already gained quite a bit of coverage by the media. On top of this, those coverages  
talked about it like the project was **definility** coming. Remember, this was just a concept in it's baby-shoe's, so to find out [vice](https://www.vice.com/nl/article/kzge4x/gabrielle-bedacht-een-app-waardoor-vrouwen-zich-veiliger-kunnen-voelen-op-straat) to talk about like it was coming next month
baffled me. 

It did, however, spark allot of interest in the team (atleast, through my observations) to hone this concept.  
So, we started to talk about the vision and how we as designers would try to make it more accesible by maybe not clutching towards calling people,
as this would be quite expensive. We've discussed a 'message-first' system, where the System would fire a text-message to the group in question first, with a link for them to call the distressed damsel (or guy).
Even though Gabrielle seemed to like this idea once she understood it, it became apparant she had her eyes already set on the price and thus also wanted to discuss optional ways for the call service to work.
We've also discussed various directions the app could go into, like a route sharer to make your friends more aware of your travel.

What really shined through after this was Gabrielle's strong focus on making the user feel safe, idea's like allowing close friends to jump into the action through location was something
she wasn't too keen it, because it would take the responsibilty away from the user, and thus creating a potentially exploitable system.

## From concept to design
Now, as it turns out, the app already had a really rudimentairy [design](https://www.doneeractie.nl/mygappie-app/-5026). We used this design as a 
entry point to polish the design, create more synergy and make it sparkle allot more. https://easy-saw.glitch.me/
