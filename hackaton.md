# Hackathon
On the may 20th the minor web development made us attend a half-day hackathon for the [http://www.hva.nl/opleiding/en/master-digital-design/master-digital-design.html](master digital design).  

## Introduction
The students/attendee's had a lot of crazy and fun idea's; a sensor to manipulate sleep patterns, an app to record interviews and have an easy overview, a 'note' system for images and more!  
Between these concepts, there was one in particular that sparked my interest, *myGappie*, pitched by [Gabrielle Claushuis](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/gabrielle-claushuis-46047580). This concept was aiming to make victims of stalking/assaults in the public feel more save by allowing these victims to quickly 'mass-call' multiple friends/family members to ensure a quick response. What really peaked my interest about this concept was that it was quite clear the one who thought about the concept,  
didn't really work out the details, which meant to me that there were a lot of design challenges that could be tackled.  
In the end, A team of 4 including myself decided to accompany Gabrielle.

## The in's and outs of MyGappie
After the team formed, we got a rundown from Gabrielle about MyGappie.  
To be quite frank, I was quite shocked at first. It became clear that the concept already gained quite a bit of coverage by the media. On top of this, those coverages talked about it like the project was **definitely** coming. Remember, this was just a concept in its baby shoes, so to find out [vice](https://www.vice.com/nl/article/kzge4x/gabrielle-bedacht-een-app-waardoor-vrouwen-zich-veiliger-kunnen-voelen-op-straat) to talk about like it was coming next month
baffled me. 

It did, however, spark allot of interest in the team (at least, through my observations) to hone this concept.  
So, we started to talk about the vision and how we as designers would try to make it more accessible by maybe not clutching towards calling people,
as this would be quite expensive. We've discussed a 'message-first' system, where the System would fire a text-message to the group in question first, with a link for them to call the distressed damsel (or guy).
Even though Gabrielle seemed to like this idea once she understood it, it became apparent she had her eyes already set on the price and thus also wanted to discuss optional ways for the call service to work.
We've also discussed various directions the app could go into, like a route sharer to make your friends more aware of your travel.

What really shined through after this was Gabrielle's strong focus on making the user feel safe, idea's like allowing close friends to jump into the action through location was something
she wasn't too keen on it, because it would take the responsibility away from the user, and thus create a potentially exploitable system.

## From concept to design
Now, as it turns out, the app already had a really rudimentary [design](https://www.doneeractie.nl/mygappie-app/-5026). We used this design as an
entry point to polish the design, create more synergy and make it sparkle allot more. https://easy-saw.glitch.me/
We did this through walking through the design first. The aim was to create a simple interface that could be used Gabrielle as an early mockup. This was exciting because while seeing the workflow of my peers, it really dawned on me why visual design can have a huge impact on the concept itself. Through quick iterations which were reviewed by Gabrielle, we had no problems creating something that reflected the ideas of Gabriella.

Once the design process started, I & the guy talking about telephone signals started working on the code base. We fairly quickly and dirty threw something together generate random users that were grouped together to reflect the wish of being able to create different "gappy groups". In some situations, you want to alert your best friends but in other cases, your mother is your best option. 
We also made a mockup of sharing your destination to a group, this way they can anticipate if the route was supposed to take 5 minutes, but after 20 minutes no one has heard something from you. This paired nicely together with the panic button on the home screen, with 1 click on the button you would call a fixed number to simulate how the system should be used.

## My overall experience
I've really enjoyed this hackathon, experiencing first hand how designers can think outside the box and quickly put something up for the customer to steer them in the right direction. I myself got quite creative too, for example suggesting the 'text-first-call-later' system, and a bunch of other pointers that hadn't been thought about. Having the sense we were helping someone with a great concept but a horrible plan was motivating for all four of us I believe.  
One of us even ended up taking this concept to the new level in the "Meesterproef"
