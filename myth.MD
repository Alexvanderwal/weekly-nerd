# The bridge between front-end and back-end is a myth

I realize the title is quite a bold statement, and I want to stress that i'm not trying to say that there is no real difference between the two, because there is. But one thing i have noticed in the industry,
are proffesionals thinking the other field is either impossible to reach, or not beneficial to their work directly.
During this minor i've realized how much bullshit this actually is. Front-enders create a beautifull display for the logic & data the back-enders provide.
It's not uncommon for bussiness to have quite a clear seperation between their back-enders and front-enders. TamTam was a good example of this, their
front-enders got their part and the backenders their own, and there would be little direct conversation other than at meetings or the occasional email.
But is this really enough? Personally, I don't think it is. We can use each others wisdom and expertise to hone the product to something that can go above expecatations, because we aren't limiting ourselves to our own bubble.  

But to actually make this a reality, we have to start with ourselves. Part of the reasoning behind the minor was to enable myself to communicate more clearly what I wanted to front-enders. But, even with knewing this before hand,
I wasn't able to phantom the benefits this actually had. By knowing about both worlds (granted, front-end allot less than back-end) I started to see things people around me didn't see.
Things only someone with my technological knowledge could see, because they would be rather technical limitations. The other way around is true aswell,
people around me saw things I didn't saw about my work, better yet, they would usually inspire me to do something completely different, and I had the same effect on them.
Especially 1 student, who I saw transform from someone that had great talent but was quite technically limited to a more rounded front-ender, something he quite needed.

This made me realize how important it is for us to work together in the same environment, ask each other questions. Because even if there was no direct answer to the question, 
having a completely different vision that isn't locked in by your tunnel vision, creates amazing and loving products.

Taking all these experiences really fuels my drive to inspire other to stop thinking you should do 1 thing and 1 thing alone. Being a expert
in 1 field doesn't make you a good web-developer, being able to communicate what you want to communicate through your work is what's really important, and we can't do that alone.
So, take up something that isn't in your comfort zone or your expertise, maybe something you thought of as impossible or unreachable for you, and ask the ones better at it to support you on your journey.
In the end we have to work together anyways, so why wouldn't we walk the entire way together, becoming great and dear friends along the way?
